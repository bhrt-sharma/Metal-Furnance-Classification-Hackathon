# Metal-Furnance-Hackathon

#1 The datawhich was provided to the contestent was masked and in order to use the data correctly we had to find hidden relation of each feature with the target and among the other features.

#2 The problem was a imbalnaced classed problem, so to solve this, i used SMOTE to balance the classes.

#3 It was a classification problem

#4 applied various algorithm like 
DecisionTreeClassifier, XGBClassifier, CatBoostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier  AdaBoostClassifier, SVC, BaggingClassifier,  KNeighborsClassifier,  GaussianNB, HistGradientBoostingClassifier, LGBMClassifier.

and ended up # ensembling the best of them.
